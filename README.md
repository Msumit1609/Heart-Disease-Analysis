**Heart Attack Analysis Project :**

 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, SQL queries,
and machine learning to identify key risk factors that contribute to heart attacks.The goal of this project is to provide insights into patient health parameters and build
predictive models that can assist in the early detection of heart disease.

**Steps Performed**

1.Data Preprocessing
  a.Handling missing values
  b.Encoding categorical variables
  c.Normalizing/standardizing features
  
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 a.Age distribution
 b.Chest pain type analysis
 c.Cholesterol vs Resting BP trends
 d.Correlation heatmap for feature importance

3.SQL Queries
 a.Performed queries for data filtering, grouping, and aggregation
 b.Extracted insights using SQL operations

4.Visualization
 a.Multiple charts and heatmaps created for clear insights

**Results & Insights**
1.Age and chest pain type are strong indicators of heart disease.
2.High cholesterol and resting blood pressure show significant correlation with heart disease risk.
3.Among machine learning models, XGBoost performed best in prediction accuracy.

**Tech Stack**

1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Psycopg2)
2.SQL (for database operations and queries)
3.Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and modeling)
